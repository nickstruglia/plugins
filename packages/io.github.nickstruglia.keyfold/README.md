# Keyfold

A key manager for Standard Notes: crypto seed phrases and wallet keys, plus SSH and PGP keys, API tokens and recovery
codes. Each entry folds into a one-line card, secrets stay hidden until revealed, seed phrases and keys are checked for
typos (BIP39 and Electrum checksums, Base58Check, Bech32, PGP armor), and an optional vault password encrypts the
whole note again (AES-256-GCM, PBKDF2-SHA256 with 600,000 iterations). Encrypted backup files open in a single-file
offline viewer, without Standard Notes.

Its Content Security Policy blocks every outgoing connection (`connect-src 'none'`), and scripts, images and fonts
from other sites. The only runtime dependency is Preact.

- This copy: version 1.0.23, built from commit [`9f45f89`](https://github.com/nickstruglia/standard-notes-keyfold/commit/9f45f89f194865a94d26670187a58817eb2f2854)

## Why the files are prebuilt

This repository builds its packages on Node 16, and Keyfold's build (Vite 8) needs Node 20.19 or newer. So
`prebuilt/` holds the output of Keyfold's own build for this package's address, and `yarn build` checks every file
against `SHA256SUMS` before copying it to `dist/`.

## Rebuilding and comparing

With Node 22.12 or newer:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nickstruglia/standard-notes-keyfold.git
cd standard-notes-keyfold
git checkout 9f45f89f194865a94d26670187a58817eb2f2854
npm ci --ignore-scripts
node scripts/directory-package.mjs 1.0.23
diff -r directory-package/io.github.nickstruglia.keyfold/prebuilt <this folder>/prebuilt
diff directory-package/io.github.nickstruglia.keyfold/SHA256SUMS <this folder>/SHA256SUMS
```

The script builds Keyfold for `https://standardnotes.github.io/plugins/cdn/dist/static/io.github.nickstruglia.keyfold/dist/` and writes this folder, with the same files byte for byte.
